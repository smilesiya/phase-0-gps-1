I was struggling with how to merge the branches and also the GitHub and Git commands 
After the GPS, I feel my mind is more clear on how to swtich and the branches. 
I did not attend the GPS, so I do not have answer for this question. 
I feel I understand the workflow well.
I worked on the task sololy.
